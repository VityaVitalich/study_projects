# study_projects
Projects, that were done as a practice on open or collected datasets.
Everything is divided by the ML Sphere sections. Further info placed in each section Readme.

# Classical ML
Everything connected with classical algorithms, such as Regressions, Trees, GB, Time Series, etc.
Could be found [here](./Classic_ML)

# Computer Vision
Everything connected with Deep Learning and Images or Videos, such as Image Classification, Detection, etc. Not connected with Generative Modeling
Could be found [here](./CV/)

# Generative Models
Everything connected with generation of images.
Could be found [here](./generative_models/)

# Recommendations
Everything connected with recommendation systems, including classic ML and DL
Could be found [here](./Recommender_Systems/)

# Convex Optimization
Everything connected with convex optimization algorithms: analytical solution, code realisation, experiments
Could be found [here](./Convex_Opt/)

# Hachathons
Everything was done through different hackathons.
